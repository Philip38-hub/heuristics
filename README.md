# Heuristic Evaluation Report and Recommendations

## Overview
This repository contains the results of a heuristic evaluation conducted on the **IKEA website**, covering various usability aspects of the platform. The evaluation follows established usability heuristics and aims to improve user experience by addressing identified issues and providing actionable recommendations.

## Exercises
This project includes two main exercises:

1. **Heuristic Audit:**
   - A detailed evaluation of the IKEA website using a heuristic checklist to identify usability issues.
   - The report provides insights into areas for improvement across different heuristic categories such as visibility, error handling, consistency, and more.

2. **Recommendations Based on Heuristic Audit:**
   - A set of 3 to 6 recommendations formulated to improve the usability of the IKEA website based on the findings from the heuristic audit.
   - These recommendations cover key areas such as error messages, system feedback, navigation, and mobile usability.

## Files
1. **Heuristic Evaluation Report PDF**:  
   A PDF file that contains a detailed analysis of the heuristic evaluation.

2. **Recommendations Document PDF**:  
   A PDF document containing actionable recommendations to improve usability.

3. **README.md**:  
   This file, which outlines the project's purpose and structure.

## Heuristic Evaluation Report

The heuristic evaluation report includes findings based on the following principles:
- **Visibility of system status**

- **Consistency and standards**
- **Recognition rather than recall**
- **Flexibility, aesthetic, and minimalist design**

Each principle has been evaluated with specific focus areas, followed by recommendations to improve the overall user experience.
